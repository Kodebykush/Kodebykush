# 👋 Hi, I’m Kush (@Kodebykush)  

🔐 Aspiring Security Architect | 🧠 Cybersecurity Enthusiast | 🎮 Ex-VFX Artist Turned Hacker-in-Training

Currently diving deep into the world of cybersecurity with a focus on SOC analysis, threat detection, and network defense. I’m building my skills one lab at a time (TryHackMe premium, yes!).

Formerly crafted visual effects and 3D worlds—now reverse-engineering digital threats instead. Passionate about blending creativity with critical thinking, whether it’s securing systems or scripting solutions.

🎯 Goals:

Land a junior cybersecurity role (SOC Analyst / SecOps)

Master blue team tools and techniques

Architect secure systems from the ground up

📚 Learning: TryHackMe | Nmap | Wireshark | Splunk | Python | Linux

Let’s connect and collaborate. Always open to feedback, learning, and hacking the limits.
